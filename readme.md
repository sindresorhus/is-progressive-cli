Can be useful to make sure your images are progressive, which is important for performance:

> Progressive JPEGs are better because they are faster. Appearing faster is being faster, and perceived speed is more important that actual speed. - [Progressive JPEGs: a new best practice](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2012/progressive-jpegs-a-new-best-practice/)

The check is fast as it only reads a small part of the file.

## Install

```sh
npm install --global is-progressive-cli
```
